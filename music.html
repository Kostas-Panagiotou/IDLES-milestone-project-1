                   <h3>IDLES return with their new album “CRAWLER” – an album of reflection and healing amid a worldwide pandemic that stretched the planet’s collective mental and physical health to the breaking point.
                    </h3>
                    <h4>Frontman Joe Talbot says, “We want people who’ve gone through trauma, heartbreak, and loss to feel like they’re not alone, and also how it is possible to reclaim joy from those experiences.
                    ” IDLES albums have always been anchored by these overarching themes, but the ability of the band to juxtapose beauty and rage with humor and drama has never felt more satisfying than on “CRAWLER.”
                    </h4>
                   <h5> These stories are vividly brought to life through IDLES’ most soul-stirring music to date, recorded with co-producers Kenny Beats (Vince Staples,
                     Freddie Gibbs) and IDLES guitarist Mark Bowen. There are, of course, numerous moments that will inspire absolute mayhem in a packed concert venue,
                    but there are also fresh textures and experiments that push IDLES into thrilling new territory.
                    “I don’t really see us as a ‘rock band’ and working with Kenny [Beats] freed us of the idea of genre,” Talbot enthuses.
                    “On this album, our dissolution of ego was helped by Kenny’s humble nature and willingness to learn. He has boundless passion for making the best song possible.
                    Not the best ‘rock’ song — the best song possible.” He continues, “It was writing selfishly that helped make it possible. Reflecting.
                    Telling my own story. Not trying to tell everyone else’s story. Not trying to fix the world — just talking about how I am fixing mine.”</h5>
                     <br>Crawler will be released on 12th November 2021 on Partisan Records.

         <img src="assets/images/ultra.png" alt="this is ultra mono"><br>                         
                  <p>Following Brutalism (2017) and Joy as an Act of Resistance (2018), two releases that garnered global critical acclaim,
                   IDLES return with their highly anticipated third album – Ultra Mono. 
                  Sonically constructed to capture the feeling of a hip-hop record (including production contribution from Kenny Beats),
                   the album doubles down on the vitriolic sneer and blunt social commentary 
                  of their past work. Not far beneath the surface of their self-admitted sloganeering lies
                   a deeply complex and brutally relevant album that chews up clichés and spits them out as high art for the masses.
                   This is momentary acceptance of the self. This is Ultra Mono.</p>
                    <br>Ultra Mono will be released on 25th September 2020 on Partisan Records.

                  <p>A Beautiful Thing: IDLES Live at Le Bataclan is the brand new live album from IDLES, 
                  recorded at Le Bataclan in Paris on 3rd December 2018, at the close of a 90 date world tour. 
                  The album celebrates the band’s success over the last two years, featuring songs 
                  from Brutalism and Joy as an Act of Resistance, 
                  and highlights their overall message of unity,
                   and of healing through community.</p>

                <br> “Our show at Bataclan was the end of a very long journey for us. 
                  On that tour we learnt so much about ourselves, each other and the audiences we have grown 
                  with over the past 10 years. That show was nothing short of catharsis and nothing more than love.
                   We love what we do and the people who have carried us here,
                    there was no hiding that at Bataclan and we are so very grateful
                     that the moment was captured in all its glory, love and fatigue. 
                     Long live the open minded and long live the moment.” – Joe Talbot

                    <p>Joy As An Act Of Resistance is a parade.

                    It’s a parade of laughing at the funeral, of listening to the bastards, 
                   of phlegm on the mirror. It’s a parade of my Grandfather’s wit, it is all the shit haircuts 
                   I’ve ever had. It is a parade of naivety, of a warm embrace, it is Young Thug’s dress. 
                   It’s the parade of being carried through the grim dark. It’s a parade of laughing 
                   at yourself. It is love. It is loving yourself. It is a parade of Tony Benn’s smile.
                   It is Idles, for now. It’s the beautiful smell of immigrant food. It is a parade of vulnerability.
                   It is Ilie Nastase It’s a parade of being at your worst. It is our best, for now. It is our thank you. 
                   It is our sorry. It is a parade without fluff but with a tonne of glitter and violence. 
                   It is a parade of what I truly miss and what I truly have. It is a parade of the second album. 
                   It is us cutting it’s fucking head off. It is a parade of joy in the face of all we don’t
                   want and all we fear. It is a parade of you.
                   Thank You. (Joe Talbot – IDLES)</p>

        alt="brutalism">
                  <p>In a time of polarised politics and murky waters; IDLES and bands like them are needed to remind people that it’s 
                  ok to dance and laugh and sing in the face of adversity. Bristol’s finest post-punk polemics IDLES have been promising
                   to do great things for some time now,
                   and with their debut album “Brutalism” they absolutely fulfill that promise, and a furious promise at that.</p>

        <img src="assets/images/marxist.png"
        alt="mercedes marxist">
                 <p>Following the release of 2018’s critically acclaimed album ‘Joy as an Act of Resistance’, IDLES are back with two new songs,
                  pulled from the aforementioned album sessions. The Mercedes Marxist 
                 contains “Mercedes Marxist”  and “I Dream Guillotine”</p>
                 <br>“Mercedes Marxist was a strange beast for us, after Rottweiler, it was the first song we wrote for Joy as an Act of Resistance.
                  I was pissed off at what I was and where I was: I was sofa surfing on the weekends and spending the weeks looking after my mum. 
                  My life balance was way off and this song reflects just how useless I felt.
                  It was me at my worst and without any buoyancy it became catharsis. It was the last splurge from Brutalism so we omitted it. I like it now. 
                                                          (Joe Talbot – IDLES)”

                 <p>On Meat, you can hear IDLES building the foundation of the sound we know them for today.
            In just 4 tracks, IDLES made Meat an EP to remember. It gave fans something to bite into before following it up with the masterpiece that is Brutalism.</p>
